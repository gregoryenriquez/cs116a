This program demonstrates how to create mouse-driven menus through the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT).

* When the user clicks the left mouse button, a menu appears.
* When the user's mouse hovers over that the menu item, a sub-menu is drawn.
* When the user's mouse hovers over the submenu, one of three options is selectable.
* When the user selects of the three options, that option is returned as an event to the program indicating what menu item was selected by the user.

To build this program on Linux or OSX, type "make" (no quotes) in a terminal window on the command line.

Note: use the OSX-Makefile (rename it to Makefile) if you are on OSX. Use Makefile if you are using Linux.
