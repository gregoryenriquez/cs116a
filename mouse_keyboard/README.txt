This GLUT program uses event driven programming to monitor for mouse and keyboard events to move 2D objects (triangle, circle, and square) on the screen.

To build this program on Linux or OSX, type "make" (no quotes) in a terminal window on the command line.

Note: use the OSX-Makefile (rename it to Makefile) if you are on OSX. Use Makefile if you are using Linux.
