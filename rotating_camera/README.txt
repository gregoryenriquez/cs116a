This GLUT program demonstrates how to animate or move the camera in OpenGL. The program draws three spheres on the screen: one red, one green, and one blue. Then the camera rotates in a cicular motion around the three spheres. The camera remains focused on the three spheres as it rotates around them.

To build this program on Linux or OSX, type "make" (no quotes) in a terminal window on the command line.

Note: use the OSX-Makefile (rename it to Makefile) if you are on OSX. Use Makefile if you are using Linux.
